                Hi, Chuks Okoh. An IT specialist who enjoys working behind the scenes to make things run smoothly.
                Iâ€™m passionate about <br />problem-solving, and finding quiet joy in the simple things.
                <br />Iâ€™m naturally calm and reserved, but being around people I love <br />keeps me going.
                <br />This wedding is more than a ceremony for me. Itâ€™s a celebration of love, friendship, faith, and choosing someone over and over <br />again.
                Iâ€™m grateful youâ€™re here to share in this special moment with us. <br />ðŸ’š
