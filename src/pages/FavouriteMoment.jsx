    text:  `After we met in 2019, Chuks travelled that same week, and what followed was weeks of us talking and getting to know each other as friends, all online.

Fast forward to January 5th, we had both spent the holidays with our families and were meant to return to Ibadan. We decided to travel together from Ogun State to Oyo State. It was simple, but so special.

That trip became one of our most unforgettable bonding moments ‚Äî lots of gist, laughs, and quiet glances. Nothing fancy, just the beginning of something we didn‚Äôt even know was growing.`,

    text:  `It was the night after an election at the corper‚Äôs lodge, Ayobami had just contested for ACLO and didn‚Äôt win. Naturally, She wasn‚Äôt feeling the best.

        Then Chuks, with his usual calm presence, suggested we take one of our aimless strolls around the barracks. (Something we had already made a habit of)

        Somehow, that stroll led us all the way to Chicken Republic in Mokola, both of us in flip-flops, unbothered and just enjoying each other's company.

        No fancy plans, no pressure,  just two people walking, talking, and laughing their way into something special.
        Definitely a night to remember. üíö

        Honestly? We didn‚Äôt enjoy the party much. But somehow, having each other there made it bearable.

        It wasn‚Äôt about the music or the crowd. It was just us, sharing glances, inside jokes, and another quiet memory that became part of our story. üíö

        On February 22nd, 2025, we had our introduction ceremony ‚Äî a beautiful, heartfelt day surrounded by our families and loved ones.

        It was filled with laughter, prayers, and warm embraces ‚Äî a celebration of not just our love, but the two families becoming one. üíö
